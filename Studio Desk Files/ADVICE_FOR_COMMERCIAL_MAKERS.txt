# Advice for Commercial Makers

This is a product design downloaded from the Opendesk.cc website. Whilst it is
widely distributed as a download, it is *not* licensed for commercial use.

This means that you can't use it for commercial purposes, which include selling
and / or being paid to fabricate it, without first obtaining a commercial license.

For information on how to obtain a commercial license to (re)sell or fabricate
the design, which ensures that the original designer will receive a royalty,
